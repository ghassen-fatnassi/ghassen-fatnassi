# Yo, I'm Ghassen Fatnassi 👋

Engineering student bruteforcing AI from its 3 perspectives: MATH , SOFTWARE and METAL.

I’m all about:

🔥 Parallel Computing  
⚙️ PyTorch Internals  
🚀 Model Distillation  
🧠 LLMs and AI Ideas  
💻 Low-Level Optimizations  

## My Tech Stack:

- **CUDA** for GPU computing  
- **PyTorch** for deep learning  
- **C++** for performance tuning  
- **Git** for version control  
- **ISPC** for parallel processing  
- **Hugging Face** for LLMs  

Let’s break things and build something awesome together!
